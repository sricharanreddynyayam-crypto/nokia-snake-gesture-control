A classic Nokia Snake game controlled by hand gestures via webcam using MediaPipe and OpenCV. Experience the nostalgia of Nokia Snake with modern AI-powered gesture recognition!

## Features

### 🎮 Classic Nokia Snake Game
- Authentic Nokia-style graphics with green monochrome theme
- Grid-based movement with rectangular snake segments
- Growing snake mechanics - snake grows when eating fruit
- Collision detection - game ends when hitting walls or self
- Score tracking - earn points by eating fruit
- Smooth animations with particle effects

### 👋 Hand Gesture Controls
- MediaPipe hand tracking for real-time gesture recognition
- Swipe gestures - move hand up/down/left/right to control snake direction
- Pinch gesture - bring thumb and index finger together for speed boost
- Face detection - shows your face in the gesture window
- Visual feedback - see hand landmarks and current direction

### 🪟 Dual Window Interface
- **Game Window** - Classic Nokia Snake gameplay
- **Gesture Window** - Live webcam feed with hand tracking visualization

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the setup script to automatically install all required packages:

```bash
python setup.py
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Webcam (built-in or external)
- Required packages:
  - opencv-python >= 4.8.0
  - mediapipe >= 0.10.0
  - numpy >= 1.24.0
  - pygame >= 2.4.0

## Controls

### Hand Gestures

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Swipe Up | Move snake up |
| Swipe Down | Move snake down |
| Swipe Left | Move snake left |
| Swipe Right | Move snake right |
| Pinch (thumb + index) | Speed boost |

### Game Controls

- **ESC** - Quit game
- **Show UP gesture when game over** - Restart game
- **Q in gesture window** - Quit

## Game Mechanics

### Snake Behavior
- Snake moves continuously in the current direction
- Cannot move directly backward (prevents instant death)
- Speed increases when pinch gesture is detected
- Snake grows by one segment when eating fruit

### Scoring
- +10 points per fruit eaten
- Score displayed in top-left corner
- Final score shown on game over screen

### Game Over Conditions
- Snake hits the wall boundaries
- Snake collides with its own body
- Show UP gesture to restart

## Technical Details

### Game Engine
- Pygame for game graphics and window management
- Grid-based movement (20x20 pixel grid cells)
- 60 FPS display refresh rate
- Variable game speed (8-15 FPS based on difficulty)

### Computer Vision
- MediaPipe Hands for hand landmark detection
- MediaPipe Face Detection for face tracking
- OpenCV for video capture and processing
- Real-time gesture analysis with movement thresholds

### Architecture
- Threaded design - game and gesture detection run in parallel
- Modular code - separate classes for game logic and gesture control
- Event-driven - gestures trigger game state changes

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues

**Error: Could not open webcam**
- Ensure webcam is connected and not used by other applications
- Try changing camera index in `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `1` or `2`
- Check camera permissions in your OS settings

### Package Installation Issues

**Failed to install package**
- Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install packages individually: `pip install opencv-python`
- Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts

### Performance Issues

- **Low FPS**: Close other applications using the camera
- **Gesture lag**: Ensure good lighting and clear hand visibility
- **Game stuttering**: Lower the game resolution in `snake_game.py`

## Customization

### Adjust Gesture Sensitivity

In `gesture_controller.py`, modify:

```python
self.gesture_threshold = 0.05  # Lower = more sensitive
```

### Change Game Speed

In `snake_game.py`, modify:

```python
self.base_speed = 8      # Normal speed (FPS)
self.boost_speed = 15    # Boost speed (FPS)
```

### Modify Colors

In `snake_game.py`, change color constants:

```python
self.NOKIA_GREEN = (155, 188, 15)  # Snake body color
self.LIGHT_GREEN = (204, 255, 51)  # Snake head color
```

## Development

### Adding New Gestures

1. Extend `detect_gestures()` in `gesture_controller.py`
2. Add gesture recognition logic using MediaPipe landmarks
3. Return new gesture type in the function
4. Handle new gesture in `main.py` game loop

### Modifying Game Mechanics

1. Edit game logic in `snake_game.py`
2. Add new features to the `SnakeGame` class
3. Update the drawing methods for visual changes
